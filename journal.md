thought of having two layers of objects.

the first a bigObject that holds all the smaller objects inside it. 


either {

each small object should includes 
a single index from all the input arrays

so... bigObject[0]
is the first small object...

and the first small object looks like

// an example of what the first small object in the bigObject may look like

firstPossibleSmallObjXxample = {
countries : countries[0],
CorrectAnswer : correctCounter[0]
boolCorrect = false;
userGuess = prompt('whatever the user puts in for an answer, either yes or no),


var x = 'access to a method that can check if userGuess === CorrectAnswer and if it doesset boolCorrect to equal true.';

}


or || or || or

each small object should just be the contents of each of those arrays

secondPossibleExampleSmallObjExample = {
countries : countries,
CorrectAnswer : correctAnswer;
// boolCorrect : an array of all the boolCorrects that have accumulated each time the user guesses correctly;

// if could be a function that returns the boolCorrect at index[i]

// correctCounter: could be a function that accumulates each time a bool is set true, or an array that gets pushed into when true,
}

}
